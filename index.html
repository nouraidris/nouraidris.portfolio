  <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Noura Idris. I'm Eritrean (East African) and I was born and raised in Saudi Arabia.   I moved to the United States in 2012, currently living and residing in San Jose, California.Growing up I never dreamed of the things I have accomplished today, such as continuing my education and being independent. Being an immigrant in America I have had to work extremely hard to fight the odds that were against me. Even on a smaller scale of pursuing a path other than what my parents have designed for me. Art is my passion and Digital Media is my voice.  
     </p>  My passion for Digital Media started with photography. I have been practicing photography for six years now. Through editing my pictures and creating digital collages I have stumbled upon the world of Digital Media. I  have enjoyed expressing myself through creating fantasy collages and experimenting with video. However, Digital Media has opened a vast new world for me, allowing me to express myself far beyond measures. It allowed me to create pieces that are interactive and engaging.  Creating videos, illustrations and, 3D figures has allowed me to express deeper and more complex topics in sophisticated ways.  A Lot of my projects are cultural and socio-political. I would describe my art as being Digitally focused and provoking at times.  I use software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, and Premiere to make these works possible. I enjoy discovering new mediums and challenging myself. A recent work that I believe embodies that is a project I created called "Infect". I used different mediums and tools such as woodworking, soldering, and code programming to create a mixed media interactive installation. "Infect" is derived from the pandemic and the idea of metastasizing. This project resembles more than just the spread of the virus. It explores the concept of surrounding energies and influences.  I believe that the habits and attitudes of those around us transfer and form who we become. Infect was a new approach for me. I had to learn new mediums and solve problems that occurred along the way. I successfully created an interactive wooden board that consists of the word “infect” with bulbs that sequentially light up in the presence of an object within 2 feet which was made possible by adding a sensor to detect proximity. This project was an example of challenging myself and experimenting with mixed media. I’m proud of the progress I have made and I'm eager to learn more and further refine the artist in me. I want to create thought-provoking art, discuss topics that are considered controversial, and deal with the issues there are using art.   </p>
